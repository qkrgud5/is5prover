1) It's better to apply those derived rules which are invertible. Determine if a derived rule is invertible.

2) We print in the output tex file only those derived rules that analyze the local context. 
Other symmetric derived rules analyzing the global or an accessible context can also be printed.

3) Test on more benchmark formulas.
